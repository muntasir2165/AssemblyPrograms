<H3>Differences between 680x0 family and ColdFire</H3>

<P>Although the ColdFire architecture is closely related to the
680x0, there are many simplifications to the instruction set. Nearly
all of the differences are omissions from the 680x0 instruction set
and addressing modes. This means that (with a few important
exceptions detailed below), a 680x0 instruction which is implemented
in ColdFire behaves in exactly the same way under the two
architectures. In fact, almost all user-level (and much
supervisor-level) ColdFire code can be run unchanged on a 68020 or
later 680x0 processor (apart from new instructions introduced in the
Version 4 ColdFire core). The converse, however, is not the case.
</P>

<P>In outline, the main omissions fall into five categories:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Missing addressing modes
   
   <LI>Missing instructions
   
   <LI>Non-availability of word- and byte-forms of nearly all
   arithmetic and logical instructions
   
   <LI>Many instructions act only on registers, not on memory
   
   <LI>Restrictions on available addressing modes for particular
   instructions
   
   <LI>Simplification of the supervisor-level programming model
</UL>

<H4>Principles behind the differences</H4>

<P>In order to understand the ColdFire instruction set in relation to
that of the 680x0, it helps to have an appreciation of why the
simplifications have been made. The philosophy behind ColdFire is
influenced by the success of RISC processors in providing high
performance - for a given degree of chip complexity - by eliminating
seldom-used instructions and complex addressing modes, and by
regularizing the instruction set to make it easier for the hardware
to optimize despatch of the instruction stream.</P>

<P>However, standard RISC processors such as the PowerPC achieve high
performance at the expense of low code density, in part because all
instructions are the same width (generally 4 bytes) and also because
only very simple addressing modes are available. In addition, RISC
processors do not allow direct modification of memory locations; all
memory reads and writes have to go via registers. This all means that
programs compiled for RISC processors tend to be substantially larger
than those compiled for CISC architectures such as the 680x0. This
penalty does not greatly matter for desktop systems or servers
with 32MB or more of RAM, but for embedded applications it can be a
significant disadvantage, both in terms of system cost and power
consumption.</P>

<P>The ColdFire architecture - which Freescale Semiconductor characterizes as
"Variable-Length RISC" - aims to share many of the speed advantages
of RISC, without losing too much of the code density advantages of
the 680x0 family. Like most modern processor architectures, it is
optimized for code written in C or C++, and instructions which are
not frequently generated by compilers are amongst those removed from
the instruction set. Some of the complex addressing modes - again not
important for compilers - are eliminated, and the additional hardware
complexities involved in supporting arithmetic operations on bytes
and words also disappear. In order to regularize the instruction
stream, all ColdFire instructions are either 2, 4 or 6 bytes wide;
this is why certain combinations of source and destination operands
are not available.</P>

<H4>Missing addressing modes</H4>

<P>The ColdFire addressing modes are quite similar to those of the
original 68000, i.e. without the extensions introduced in the 68020
and later processors, but with some differences in indexed
addressing. Compared with a 68020 or later processor, the comparison
is as follows:</P>

<H5>Fully supported:</H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Data Register Direct
   
   <LI>Address Register Direct
   
   <LI>Address Register Indirect
   
   <LI>Post-increment
   
   <LI>Pre-decrement
   
   <LI>Displacement (16-bit displacement)
   
   <LI>PC Displacement (16-bit displacement)
   
   <LI>Absolute Short
   
   <LI>Absolute Long
   
   <LI>Immediate
</UL>

<H5>Partially supported:</H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Indexed
   
   <LI>PC Indexed
</UL>

<P>The restrictions on these two modes are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The displacement constant is 8-bit only;
   
   <LI>"Zero-suppressed" registers are not supported;
   
   <LI>The Index register can only be handled as a Long. Word-length
   index registers are not supported.
   
   <LI>The scale factor must be 1, 2, or 4. Scale factors of 8 are
   not supported.
</UL>

<H5>Not implemented at all:</H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Memory-indirect post-indexed
   
   <LI>Memory-indirect pre-indexed
   
   <LI>PC-indirect post-indexed
   
   <LI>PC-indirect pre-indexed
</UL>

<P>Note that further restrictions may be imposed on the addressing
modes supported by particular instructions, even if a particular
addressing mode is itself available on ColdFire.</P>

<H4>Missing instructions</H4>

<P>A number of instructions are not implemented at all under
ColdFire. These include:</P>

<P>DBcc, EXG, RTR, RTD, CMPM,</P>

<P>ROL, ROR, ROXL, ROXR, MOVE16</P>

<P>ABCD, SBCD, NBCD</P>

<P>BFCHG, BFCLR, BFEXTS, BFEXTU</P>

<P>BFFFO, BFINS, BFSET, BFTST</P>

<P>CALLM, RTM, PACK, UNPK</P>

<P>CHK, CHK2, CMP2, CAS, CAS2, TAS <I>(restored in V4 core)</I>,</P>

<P>BKPT, BGND, LPSTOP, TBLU, TBLS, TBLUN, TBLSN</P>

<P>TRAPV, TRAPcc, MOVEP, MOVES, RESET</P>

<P>ORI to CCR, EORI to CCR, ANDI to CCR</P>

<P>In addition, DIVS and DIVU (with some differences from the 680x0
equivalents) are available on some ColdFire processors but not
others. MULU and MULS producing a 64-bit result are not implemented,
but 16 x 16 producing 32-bit, and 32 x 32 producing (truncated)
32-bit, are available.</P>

<H4>Long-word forms only</H4>

<P>Most arithmetic and logical instructions can act on Long words
only. This applies to:</P>

<P>ADD, ADDA, ADDI, ADDQ, ADDX, AND, ANDI, ASL, ASR</P>

<P>CMP, CMPI <I>(word/byte forms re-introduced in version 4 core)</I>
</P>

<P>CMPA, EOR, EORI, LSL, LSR,</P>

<P>NEG, NEGX, NOT, OR, ORI,</P>

<P>SUB, SUBA, SUBI, SUBQ, SUBX</P>

<P>MOVEM.W has also been removed from the instruction set.</P>

<P>In fact, the only instructions which do act on the full set of
byte, word and long operands are CLR, MOVE and TST (and CMP and CMPI
in the version 4 core). EXT.W, EXTB.L and EXT.L survive, as do MULx.W
and MULx.L</P>

<H4>Instructions which act only on registers, not on memory</H4>

<P>Some arithmetic instructions cannot act directly on memory - the
destination must be a register. This applies to:</P>

<P>ADDI, ADDX, ANDI, CMPI, ASL, ASR, LSL, LSR,</P>

<P>NEG, NEGX, NOT, EORI, ORI, SUBI, SUBX, Scc</P>

<P>Note that ADDQ and SUBQ <B>can</B> act directly on memory.</P>

<H4>Restrictions on addressing modes for particular instructions
</H4>

<P>Even where a particular memory addressing mode does exist in
ColdFire, some instructions are subject to further restrictions.
Often, this is because of the limit of six bytes as the maximum
length of a single instruction. Specific restrictions include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Some combinations of addressing modes for MOVE are disallowed.
   If the source addressing mode is Displacement or PC Displacement,
   the destination addressing mode cannot be Indexed or Absolute. If
   the source addressing mode is Indexed, PC-Indexed, Absolute
   or Immediate, the destination addressing mode cannot be Indexed,
   Displacement, or Absolute.
   
   <LI>The addressing modes for MOVEM are restricted to only
   Displacement and Indexed - no Pre-decrement or Post-increment!
   
   <LI>For BTST, BSET, BCLR and BCHG, if the source operand is a
   static bit number, the destination cannot be Indexed or Absolute
   memory.
</UL>

<H4>Miscellaneous Omissions</H4>

<P>There are a few miscellaneous omissions for specific instructions:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>LINK.L is not supported
   
   <LI>MOVE to CCR/SR: Source must be Immediate or Data Register
   
   <LI>MOVE from CCR/SR: Destination must be data register
   
   <LI>BSR and Bcc accept only an 8- or 16-bit displacement in
   version 2 and version 3 cores (32-bit displacements are
   reintroduced in version 4)
</UL>

<H4>Instructions which behave differently from the 680x0 equivalent
</H4>

<P>In most cases, an instruction/addressing mode which does
exist in ColdFire behaves exactly like its 680x0 equivalent, which
makes it easy for experienced 680x0 programmers to understand
ColdFire code. It also means that user-mode code written for ColdFire can
generally run unchanged on a 680x0 processor, provided the new ColdFire-only instructions are not used.</P>

<P>However, there are a few subtle cases where the ColdFire
instruction is not exactly the same as its 680x0 counterpart. The
most important of these is that multiply instructions (MULU and MULS)
do not set the overflow bit. This means that a 680x0 code sequence
which checks for overflow on multiply may assemble and run under
ColdFire, but give incorrect results.</P>

<P>ASL and ASR also differ in that they do not set the overflow bit -
but this is less likely to cause problems for real programs!</P>

<H4>Simplification of the supervisor programming model</H4>

<P>Various members of the 68000 family have different register sets
available at the supervisor level. The most important simplification
in ColdFire's supervisor-level model is that there is only one stack
pointer, shared for all code including interrupts, supervisor-level
services, and user code. It follows from this that, on ColdFire, it
is never safe to write below the stack, since any interrupt which
occurs would overwrite the stored data. (Writing below the stack,
though not recommended, is possible in some 680x0 systems in user
mode, because interrupts cause a switch to the Interrupt or
Supervisor Stack Pointer). A further issue is that ColdFire
processors automatically align the stack to a four-byte boundary when
an exception occurs, which can cause problems if code is reading or
writing at a fixed offset from the stack pointer. In fact, it is
strongly recommended (for performance reasons) that the ColdFire
stack should be kept long-word aligned at all times.</P>

<H4>New features in ColdFire Version 4 core</H4>

<P>Version 4 of the ColdFire core architecture re-introduces some
familiar 680x0 instructions, and also adds some new instructions. The
main changes are:</P>

<P><B><I>Reintroduced:</I></B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>32-bit displacement forms of BSR, Bcc and BRA
   
   <LI>Byte and Word forms of CMP and CMPI
   
   <LI>Slight relaxation of restrictions in addressing modes for MOVE
   
   <LI>Restoration of the TAS instruction
</UL>

<P><B><I>New:</I></B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>MOV3Q for moving immediate values in the range -1 to 7 to
   destination
   
   <LI>MVS moves and sign-extends in one operation
   
   <LI>MVZ moves and zero-extends in one operation
   
   <LI>SATS Saturate register if overflow set
</UL>
